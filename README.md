# To-Do App

A simple and elegant To-Do application built with **React** and **Tailwind CSS**. This app allows you to create, edit, and delete tasks, set due dates and priorities, and toggle between light and dark modes. All tasks are persisted in local storage, so they won't be lost even after refreshing the page.
